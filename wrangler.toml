# Cloudflare Pages Configuration
# Deploy via Cloudflare Dashboard, not CLI

# This file is for Pages project metadata only
# Pages deployment is handled through:
# 1. Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → Connect to Git
# 2. Auto-deploy on git push

# Note: DO NOT use `wrangler deploy` command
# Pages uses different deployment method

# Frontend: dist/
# Backend: functions/ (automatically deployed as Workers)
# R2 Binding: PDF_BUCKET → insurance-pdfs (configure in Dashboard)
